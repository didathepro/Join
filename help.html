          Welcome to the help page for <b>Join</b>, your guide to using our
          kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of
          what <b>Join</b> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>What is Join?</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Join</b> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built
        by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development
        bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
        method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
        efficiency (or flow). <b>Join</b> leverages the principles of kanban to
        help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
        interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note that <b>Join</b> is designed as an educational
        exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we
        strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee
        consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of
        quality regarding <b>Join</b>.

      <h2>How to use it</h2>
      <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <b>Join</b>:</p>

      <div class="how-to">
        <div class="number">1.</div>
        <div class="text-right" style="padding-left: 42px">
          <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
          <p>
            When you log in to <b>Join</b>, you'll find a default board. This
            board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To
            Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="how-to">
        <div class="number">2.</div>
        <div class="text-right">
          <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
          <p>
            In <b>Join</b>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
            projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and
            fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be
            assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="how-to">
        <div class="number">3.</div>
        <div class="text-right">
          <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
          <p>
            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
            Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
            appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
            the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="how-to">
        <div class="number">4.</div>
        <div class="text-right">
          <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
          <p>
            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on
            the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
            another.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="how-to">
        <div class="number">5.</div>
        <div class="text-right">
          <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
          <p>
            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list
            or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the
            board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action
            is irreversible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates
            from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current
            state of your project.
          </p>
